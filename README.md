# neowhirlybird
A remake of the Google Play built-in Whirlybird game, which has appeares to
have disappeared from many Android devices for an unknown reason.

This is still a work in progress, and there are no working binaries for the
game yet. This is my current plan:
1. Create a desktop version, controlled with arrow keys, to get the game
working.
2. Create the Android version, which is of course the main point of this
project.
3. If this works well I might also make an iOS version, but I'm not making any
promises yet.

This is a project I'm working on in my spare time, and as such, development might be a bit slow.

This project makes use of the [Kivy](https://kivy.org/) framework and its dependencies.
