# neowhirlybird
A remake of the Google Play built-in Whirlybird game, which has appeares to
have disappeared from many Android devices for an unknown reason.

This is still a work in progress, and there are no working binaries for the
game yet. This is my current plan:
1. Create a desktop version, controlled with arrow keys, to get the game
working.
2. Create the Android version, which is of course the main point of this
project.
3. If this works well I might also make an iOS version, but I'm not making any
promises yet.

This is a project I'm working on in my spare time, and as such, development
might be a bit slow.
In saying that, development is progressing much faster than I expected, but
there are some notable features of the original game still absent:
* Sounds
* Animations
* High score display - currently as I develop it, the difficulty changes a
lot, so this will not be added until I have finished balancing everything out.

This project makes use of the [Kivy](https://kivy.org/) framework and its
dependencies.
